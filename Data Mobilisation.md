# **Data mobilisation**
Biodiversity information is the key resource which drives research and innovation, supports planning and policy development processes, informs decisions and is the basis to evaluate progress and impact. It is therefore important that our biodiversity information is managed as a strategic asset that will leverage shared value to South Africa in supporting sustainable decisions towards the broader national developmental objectives.
Ultimately, we need to ensure that the data which supports our analysis, are mobilized and priority datasets are available to support analysis for amongst other things, natural capital accounting; and sectors such as energy, climate, water, food, infrastructure, mining and extractives as well as trade and investment.   In a world that counts the United Nations describe data as the lifeblood of decision making and the raw material for accountability.  Thus, good and accurate data is the key building blocks for analysis, in support the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, Biodiversity data  has a potential role in supporting a number of SDGâ€™s, the Aichi Targets of the CBD and IPBES.
