**Training and e-Learning**

**To support capacity enhancement activities in the network SANBI-GBIF aims to:** 

1. Build capacity towards ensuring that relevant, high quality biodiversity information is
available and used by scientists, managers and decision makers,
2. Grow a coordinated network of partners with the commitment and capacity to
digitise, share and use biodiversity information.

SANBI-GBIF supports the community through physical training events and an online eLearning Platform, as a repository of re-usable training materials for various
scientific areas including: data management (data cleaning, formatting and publishing), geo-referencing, data mobilisation, data use and its applications.  
SANBI wishes to acknowledge GBIF-Spain, as the host of the eLearning Technology Platform.
