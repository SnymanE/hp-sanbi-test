**SANBI-GBIF as a Catalyst for Mass Digitization Using the Conveyor Belt System.**

SANBI-GBIF is acting as a catalyst and is leading a process to implement mass digitization of Herbarium Specimens through a dynamic new technology which included a Conveyor Belt System (CBS). This revolutionary new research system developed by Bioshare Digitization (link here), is in operation for herbaria of the global north including the Arctic University Museum in Norway (insert link) and in Canda; as well as for insects at the National History Museum in Denmark (insert link( and the Museum für Naturkunde in Germany (insert link). The South African Delegation to the GBIF Governing meeting board, including members of the Science and Innovation and the SANBI-GBIF Node Manager, were introduced to the mass digitization infrastructure of the Finnish Museum of Natural History, of the University of Helsinki in September 2017. Bioshare CEO Hannu Saarenmaa presented on Bioshare digitization, the potential of the mass digitization technology to offer automated digitization equipment and integrated high-performance imaging lines. The rate of processing is estimated to be at 400-600 per hour, 2500 – 4200 sheets per day. During May/June 2023 the Conveyor Belt System (CBS) was installed at the Pretoria National Herbarium (PRE), a culmination of a visit to the Finnish Museum of Natural History. In South Africa, the CBS is being implemented by the Collections Management Directorate of SANBI, a first on the African continent.

The value of the Conveyor Belt Technology for Mass Digitization is that is allows the rate of the processing herbarium sheets, with just 1 -3 people in the operating line. The time to digitize specimens is reduced, making the process more efficient and rapid. 

SANBI-GBIF aim to promote the sharing of data and information under a common set of standards, as well as to contribute to education, training and capacity development, in order to promote national access to data. Mass Digitization of herbarium specimens, culminating in a Virtual Herbarium, will assist in reaching these aims.

**A virtual herbarium offers several benefits, especially in the fields of botany, research, conservation, and education. Here are some key advantages:**

*1.	Accessibility and Convenience:*
A virtual herbarium allows easy access to plant specimen data and images from anywhere in the world. Researchers, students, and the general public can explore and study specimens without needing to travel to physical locations.

*2.	Preservation and Sustainability:*
Plant specimens can be digitized and stored in a virtual format, ensuring that valuable data is preserved in case of physical deterioration or loss. This also reduces the need for handling delicate specimens, helping with long-term conservation. Reduced handling of material as images will be used for transcribing of label information from images into the institutional database and for quality control purposes.

*3.	Collaboration and Sharing:*
Researchers from around the globe can collaborate more easily by sharing digital specimens and data. This promotes the exchange of information and can accelerate scientific discoveries, particularly in areas like taxonomy and ecology.

*4.	Efficient Data Storage and Organization:*
Virtual herbaria enable better organization and sorting of plant specimens by categories such as species, location, collection date, and other metadata. This makes it much easier to search, sort, and analyse data compared to physical herbariums.

*5.	Educational Tools:*
Virtual herbaria serve as valuable resources for education, enabling students and the public to learn about plant biodiversity and taxonomy. They can examine high-resolution images of specimens and interact with data without needing a physical collection. Training events related to the virtual herbarium will impact students, interns and professionals and importantly, lead to the development of a community of practice.

*6.	Integration with Other Data Sources:*
Virtual herbaria can be linked to other ecological or geographical databases, enabling users to gain insights into plant distribution, climate change impacts, or ecological interactions. This integration can support broader research goals and decision-making.

*7.	Cost-Effective:*
Maintaining a virtual herbarium can be more cost-effective than maintaining a physical one. Digital storage doesn't require as much space, climate control, or personnel for specimen care, which can make it an affordable alternative for institutions with limited budgets.

*8.	Improved Disaster Preparedness:*
In case of natural disasters (fires, floods, etc.) or other events that might damage physical collections, a virtual herbarium provides a backup for specimens, ensuring that critical data and samples are not lost.

*9.	Public Awareness and Engagement:*
Digital herbariums can help raise awareness about plant conservation and biodiversity. Interactive platforms can engage the public in citizen science projects, encouraging people to document local flora or report sightings, further enriching the database.

**Overall, virtual herbaria help foster a more connected, efficient, and sustainable approach to botanical research, education, and conservation.**
