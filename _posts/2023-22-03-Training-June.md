# Call for Applications for SANBI-GBIF Training in Analytical Techniques in Biodiversity Big Data using GBIF-Making an Impact

# DATE: 26-30 June 2023


## Venue: The Iziko South African Museums, Cape Town

## Deadline for submissions: 11th April 2023

**Background and Course Content**

SANBI-GBIF in collaboration with GBIF-Spain is hosting a training workshop focused on analytical techniques in using biodiversity big data.
SANBI is the home of the South African Node of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and is funded by the Department of 
Science and Innovation.  Its vision is to contribute to South Africa's sustainable development by facilitating access to biodiversity and
related information on the internet.  This course ties into SANBI-GBIF’s strategy to develop biodiversity informatics skills nationally.

The vast quantities of biodiversity data put together in a uniform, FAIR way, and now available, in part led by GBIF,
is recognized as an enabler of high impact innovative science, and a key to respond to the current societal challenges. 
However, the exploitation of this resource is often hindered by limited capacity. 

SANBI-GBIF in Partnership with GBIF Spain are exploring ways of using big data analytics to ena-ble the mining of the data, and the
identification of some key tools, techniques and approaches that can be used to ask some pertinent research questions related to time, 
space and taxonomy.

The contents of the course will include aspects such as the GBIF API, the use of Jupyter note-books, using big data analytic techniques 
to manage aspects of data quality like time, space and taxonomy, data visualisation, species and ecosystem assessments, conservation planning 
and species distribution modelling using deep learning approaches.

**Workshop Information**

This course will include trainers from GBIF South Africa and GBIF Spain including key experts from the University of Cantabria and 
University of Cape Town (SEEC), with expertise in Data Science and Big Data Analytics. 

The workshop will take place at the IZIKO South African Museum, from the **26 June-30 June 2023**. The course will be conducted in English. 

**Target Audience and Minimum requirements for participants**

The target audience for this course would include stakeholders from research organisations, museums, herbaria, provincial organisations,
government officials, biodiversity information practitioners, academics, and students dealing with biodiversity data use and analysis.

**Minimum Requirements**

* Relevant bachelor’s degree in natural or earth science such as biology, botany, zoology, forestry, geography, or a related field of biodiversity informatics,
    or Geographic Information Systems (GIS).  Participants have found some prior experience in using R is helpful for this course, although this is not a requirement.
* Criteria for selection of participants will include: 
     * Relevance of work / study to the course.   
     * Commitment to apply and disseminate skills.    
* An effort will be made to ensure there is a racial, gender and national institutional representation among the participants
