The award fosters innovative research and discovery in biodiversity informatics by graduate students in master’s
and doctorate programmes at universities, whose studies rely on GBIF mediated data, in countries participating in 
the GBIF network.

The 2024 programme will provide €5,000 prizes recognizing the work of two early-career researchers preferably,
one master’s and one PhD candidate—nominated by the Heads of Delegation and Node Managers from [GBIF Participant countries](https://www.gbif.org/the-gbif-network) 

South Africa, as a GBIF Participant Country, will nominate two candidates selected from the national applications submitted
to the SANBI-GBIF Node until 24 May 2024. This selection will be supported through the SANBI-GBIF Graduate Researcher Award Advisory Panel.
The Department of Science and Innovation will engage with the SANBI-GBIF Node in submission of the two South African applicants to GBIF.

A jury organized by the [GBIF Science Committee](https://www.gbif.org/contact-us/directory?group=scienceCommittee) will select 
two award recipients from the pool of nominees whose names are received by the GBIF Secretariat by 24 June 2024.
The winners will be announced at the 31st meeting of the GBIF Governing Board planned for Portugal, in October 2024.
