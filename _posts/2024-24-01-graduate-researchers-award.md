*Deadline for receiving nominations from GBIF member countries for graduate students*

*whose innovative research relies on biodiversity data:* **24 June 2024**

On behalf of its network of national Participants, the GBIF Secretariat is pleased to invite nominations for the 2024 Graduate Researchers Award.
This annual programme aims to foster and recognize innovative research and discovery in biodiversity informatics by graduate students whose master’s
and doctoral studies rely on GBIF-mediated data.

The 2024 programme will provide a pair of €5,000 prizes recognizing the work of two early-career researchers—preferably, one master’s 
and one PhD candidate—who receive formal nominations from the heads of delegation or node managers of GBIF Participant countries.

A jury organized by GBIF Science Committee will select two award recipients from the pool of nominees whose names are received by the 
GBIF Secretariat by 24 June 2024. The GBIF Secretariat will announce winners before the 31st meeting of the GBIF Governing Board (GB31) and
present the winners' work at the meeting in Portugal in October 2024.
