*GBIF continues partnership with FinBIF and Pensoft to support publication of new datasets about organisms whose life cycles depend on soil*

**NEW DEADLINE: 10 November 2023**

In collaboration with the [Finnish Biodiversity Information Facility(FinBIF)](https://laji.fi/en) and [Pensoft Publishers](https://pensoft.net/), 
GBIF has announced a new call for authors to submit and publish [data papers](https://www.gbif.org/data-papers) on soil biodiversity in a special 
collection of [Biodiversity Data Journal (BDJ)](https://bdj.pensoft.net/). The call expands upon the partners’ successful efforts to mobilize data 
in 2020-2022.

Until 10 November 2023, Pensoft will waive the article processing fee (normally €650) for the first 40 accepted data paper manuscripts that meet
the following criteria for describing a dataset:

- with [more than 5,000 presence records new to GBIF.org in 2023](https://www.gbif.org/news/232EKewXfNDeh0U7vAUbsG/dig-deep-and-share-call-for-data-papers-describing-datasets-on-soil-biodiversity-extended#records)
- with [high-quality data and metadata](https://www.gbif.org/news/232EKewXfNDeh0U7vAUbsG/dig-deep-and-share-call-for-data-papers-describing-datasets-on-soil-biodiversity-extended#quality)
- with coverage of species/taxa occurring in soil at least at one stage of their life cycle
