## Course on DNA barcode data in BOLD and GBIF

**Venue: The Iziko South African Museums, Cape Town, South Africa**

**Date: 13 - 17 November**
Deadline for Submissions: 5 September 2023 

BioDATA Advanced is an international project between Norway and South Africa that aims to support students in upper education in developing skills in biodiversity data management and publishing, 
in addition to the most modern molecular methods for monitoring biodiversity. The skills taught within BioDATA Advanced are important for carrying out the everyday tasks of a modern biologist,
though many of these skills are not taught in higher education. 
This project also looks to strengthen the partnership between the South African Node of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (SANBI-GBIF) and the other BioDATA partners,
through exchanges and enhanced collaborations on scientific projects of mutual interest. 
This course will teach you how to use DNA barcodes, and collection and observation data to resolve research questions in biodiversity. The program uses a combination of lectures, tutorials,
and hands-on exercises. You will learn to handle biodiversity data including DNA barcoding. You will gain practical experience in using open and digitally documented biodiversity data
through GBIF and BOLD to answer biodiversity research questions. You will understand and practice capturing observation, collection, and genetic data from analog and digital sources. 
Finally, this course provides basic skills in data publishing through GBIF and BOLD.
