molecular and multimedia records, making them available on the internet to support research, assessment, monitoring, conservation
and decision-making. One of the key strategic objectives of the SANBI-GBIF Node is to grow and raise awareness of the field biodiversity informatics,
and to develop the capacity and skills base of biodiversity informatics professionals and practitioners in the country in the mobilisation,
analysis, use and publication of data.
