An exciting joint project entitled “BioDATA Advanced - Accelerating biodiversity research through DNA barcodes, 
collection and observation data” was submitted from the Museum of Natural History at the University of Oslo in 
cooperation with the South African National Biodiversity Institute and 
Altai State University.  This Partnership between national nodes of GBIF from 
Norway (GBIF Norway) and South Africa (SANBI-GBIF) has been successfully
approved and is to be funded by the Norwegian Agency for International Cooperation and Improvement 
of the Quality of Higher Education (DIKU), for 5 years.  It is further supported 
by Professor Dmitry Shchigel (GBIF Secretariat, Copenhagen, Denmark) and the project
is being led by Professor Hugo de Boer from the University of Oslo, Norway.

The project will offer young researchers from South Africa and Norway the opportunity 
to participate in academic mobility and professional training
in the study of biodiversity, using modern skills in the field of 
methods of obtaining, processing, publishing and using open data.
Eight courses in advanced biodiversity data skills are planned and 
six student internships.  The courses are designed to create a network of exchange
between professionals and students through targeted internships and to facilitate
open access to biodiversity data both in the participating countries and around the world.
