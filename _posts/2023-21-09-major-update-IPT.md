*Now available for review and testing, version 3 of the Integrated Publishing Toolkit accommodates more
formats and richer data while retaining full support for current standards*

The GBIF Secretariat has announced the availability of a new release candidate of its Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) 
for testing and feedback by current users.

Developed in parallel with explorations into diversifying the GBIF data model, the first release candidate will offer many users
their first glimpse of some major evolutionary changes ahead for this widely used free, open-source software.

As a release candidate this software is intended only for testing and preview purposes, not production use.
