Call for comments on proposed changes to Darwin Core
The members of the Darwin Core Maintenance Group would like to announce the opening of a minimum 30-day period for public review for the accumulated set of proposed changes to Darwin Core.
Please refer to the documentation we have provided on the review process and the maintenance of the Darwin Core standard in general at https://github.com/tdwg/dwc/wiki/Darwin-Core-Maintenance-Frequently-Asked-Questions.
For your reference and convenience we are providing a table with links to the proposed changes, organized in keeping with the order in the Darwin Core Quick Reference Guide (https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/). The relevant issues are also listed in the following milestone: https://github.com/tdwg/dwc/milestone/19.
