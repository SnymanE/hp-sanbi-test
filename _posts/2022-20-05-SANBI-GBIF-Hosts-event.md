## SANBI-GBIF Hosts Successful Data Management and Cleaning Training Event ##

The SANBI-GBIF Data Management and Cleaning for Science, Policy and Sustainable Development was held **22-24th February 2022.** 
Training expertise from the Centre for Statistics in Ecology, Environment and Conservation (SEEC) at the University of
Cape Town, SANBI and the Natural Science Collections Facility supported the event.  Approximate 20 delegates from several
universities, government agencies, national parks, including SANBI participated, and were awarded with certificates of
achievement following completion of the workshop. 

Participants indicated that the course was very relevant to supporting their work activities and appreciated the fact that
they could also work on their own datasets, as part of the course activities.  Others also enjoyed learning more about GBIF,
and the value of data sharing via SANBI-GBIF.  The use and application of R, in the course was also very stimulating to many 
of the participants. 

An interesting development at the training was also the launch of the new SANBI-GBIF website and the
[new eLearning Platform](https://www.sanbi-gbif.org/e-learning), also supported by GBIF-Spain.  Here, the SANBI-GBIF training content and curricula 
is made available on the site.  This supports the efforts to grow human capital in the field of biodiversity informatics.
