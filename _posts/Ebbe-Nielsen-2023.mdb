The 2023 Ebbe Nielsen Challenge has opened with the aim of recognizing innovations that leverage biodiversity data and tools 
from the GBIF network to advance open science. An expert jury will judge entries on their openness and repeatability, relevance and 
novelty and present a selected pool of winners with a total of up to â‚¬20,000 in prizes.
