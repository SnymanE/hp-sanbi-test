**Background**

SANBI is the home of the South African Node of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and 
is funded by the Department of Science and Innovation.  Its vision is to contribute to South Africa's 
sustainable development by facilitating access to biodiversity and related information on the internet.
This course ties into SANBI-GBIF’s strategy to develop biodiversity informatics skills nationally.  
Through this course, it is intended to focus on the use and application of data and in this way 
ensuring that information is relevant and can ultimately be used for improved decision making.  
Participants will be introduced to the R software package, and will learn about species distribution models
using Maxent in R, data types and sources, and how to handle species occurrence data.

**Workshop Information**

SANBI-GBIF is hosting a training workshop focused on technical skills in using R to do species distribution modelling. 
The course will be conducted by Dr Vernon Visser from the Centre for Statistics in Ecology, the Environment and 
Conservation (SEEC) at the University of Cape Town.  The venue will be the Iziko Museums of South Africa, Cape Town
from Tuesday the 5th to Friday the 8th March 2024. The course will be conducted in English.

training is relevant. All participants will need to bring their own laptop to work on during the course.
