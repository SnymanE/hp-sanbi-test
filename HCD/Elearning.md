**Training and e-Learning**

**To support capacity enhancement activities in the network SANBI-GBIF aims to:** 

1. build capacity towards ensuring that relevant, high quality biodiversity information is
available and used by decision makers and managers,
2. grow a coordinated network of SANBI partners with the commitment and capacity to
digitise, share and use biodiversity information.

SANBI-GBIF supports the community through physical training events and an online eLearning Platform, as a repository of re-usable training materials for various
scientific areas including: data management (data cleaning, formatting and publishing), geo-referencing, data mobilisation, data use and its applications.  
SANBI wishes to recognize GBIF-Spain who is the host of the eLearning Platform Technology.
