# Human Capital Development

In South Africa, as in other parts of the world, Biodiversity Informatics is a young field, lies at the nexus of a number of disciplines.   
The broad application of information science and computational tools to the management and analysis of biodiversity data including speciesâ€™ 
occurrences, taxonomic characters, and multimedia and image data, have led to the development of the emerging field of biodiversity informatics. 
Thus, biodiversity informatics deals with the interrelated challenges of collection, collation, integration, analysis and prediction, as well as 
the dissemination of data and information related to the biotic resources of the Earth
Being such a new and dynamic field, there are enormous challenges in recruitment, training and retention of biodiversity information management 
personnel, to support the mobilisation, management, coordination and utilisation of biodiversity information for key conservation and 
biodiversity outcomes, and initiatives such as IPBES and the Aichi targets that require relevant data to meet the science-policy and decision-making needs. 
This demands broad efforts to build human capital in the field. 
The South African Node of GBIF (SANBI-GBIF) has a mandate to share biodiversity data freely and openly, to GBIF, through a knowledge management platform in 
support of science, policy and decision-making.  In order to support this activity at the national level, and to support the move towards a knowledge economy, 
the SANBI-GBIF Node has been instrumental in developing a holistic approach to capacity development in Biodiversity Informatics.  This includes:

- i) a 5 year strategy and a curriculum for biodiversity informatics which is core to the development of academic and work-based teaching and training efforts;
- ii) developing robust in-house capacity
- iii) to improve the quality and use of data
- iv) to grow an inspired and coordinated network in biodiversity informatics/information management

**Training and e-Learning**

**To support capacity enhancement activities in the network SANBI-GBIF aims to:** 

1. build capacity towards ensuring that relevant, high quality biodiversity information is
available and used by decision makers and managers,
2. grow a coordinated network of SANBI partners with the commitment and capacity to
digitise, share and use biodiversity information.

SANBI-GBIF supports the community through physical training events and an online eLearning Platform, as a repository of re-usable training materials for various
scientific areas including: data management (data cleaning, formatting and publishing), geo-referencing, data mobilisation, data use and its applications.  
SANBI wishes to recognize GBIF-Spain who is the host of the eLearning Platform Technology.
